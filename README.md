This project is a quick rock-paper-scissors simulator which prompts user for input and plays against a computer 5 times. This is currently played in console but will be updated in the future.

What I Learned:

-how to use Chrome developer tools to debug a script, and console.log

-using javascript loops for the first time

-properly building javascript functions to be used and reused for other functions

-manipulating and dealing with arrays in javascript
