This project is a quick rock-paper-scissors simulator which prompts user for input and plays against a computer 5 times. This is currently played in console but will be updated in the future.

What I Learned:

-how to use Chrome developer tools to debug a script, and console.log

-using javascript loops for the first time

-properly building javascript functions to be used and reused for other functions

-manipulating and dealing with arrays in javascript



Update:

Added simple UI and 3 buttons for user to click, to play a first-to-five game with a computer. Will add CSS styling in the future.

What I Learned:

-using Chrome Developer tools to access DOM objects and values

-Utilizing javascript to build a functional and responsive UI which allows the user to play a simple game

-Manipulating the DOM through javascript, which allowed for many different available options to be used

-Added event listeners and reused but modified previous code to become new program I wanted
